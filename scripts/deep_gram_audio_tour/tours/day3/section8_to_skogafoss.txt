As we leave Seljalandsfoss behind and continue east along the Ring Road, we're traveling through an area profoundly shaped by the interplay between volcanism and glaciation - the defining forces of Iceland's landscape.

To the north, you can see the imposing figure of Eyjafjallajökull, the volcano-glacier combination that made headlines in 2010. The eruption caused chaos in international travel, but locally, its impact was quite different. The ash actually enriched the soil in this region, improving farming conditions in subsequent years - a perfect example of how Icelanders have adapted to living in this volatile environment.

Beyond Eyjafjallajökull, if visibility is good, you might glimpse its much larger neighbor, Mýrdalsjökull glacier, which covers Katla volcano. Katla is considerably more powerful than Eyjafjallajökull and is closely monitored by scientists as it's considered overdue for an eruption.

The landscape here tells a story of constant change. The flat plains to our right were created by glacial floods, or jökulhlaups, which occur when volcanic activity beneath glaciers suddenly melts large amounts of ice. These catastrophic floods have shaped Iceland's southern coastline, carrying massive amounts of sediment from the highlands to the sea.

Along this stretch of road, you'll notice numerous small farms nestled at the foot of the mountains. Farming in Iceland requires adaptability and resilience - the growing season is short, and the weather unpredictable. Yet Icelandic agriculture has thrived, with farmers using geothermal energy to heat greenhouses and taking advantage of the long summer daylight hours.

The unusual rock formations you might spot in this area are often the result of subglacial eruptions, where volcanoes erupted beneath ice sheets during the last ice age. These eruptions create distinctive table mountains with flat tops and steep sides, called "tuyas" by geologists.

Weather in this region can change rapidly due to the influence of both the Atlantic Ocean and the interior highlands. It's not uncommon to experience rain, sunshine, and even snow in a single day, especially in spring and autumn. The Icelandic saying "If you don't like the weather, wait five minutes" certainly applies here on the South Coast.

We're now approaching Skógafoss, another of Iceland's most impressive waterfalls, with a different character than Seljalandsfoss but equally breathtaking.
