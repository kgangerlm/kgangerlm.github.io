On our left is a small turnoff that leads to one of the South Coast's hidden gems - Nauthúsagil ravine. While we won't be stopping there on our main itinerary, it's worth noting in case you have time on a future visit.

Nauthúsagil, which means "Bull Shed Ravine," is a moss-covered canyon with a secret waterfall inside. What makes it special is the adventure required to see it - visitors must wade upstream through the narrow gorge, using a series of ropes and chains anchored to the walls, before reaching the concealed cascade within.

The ravine is like something from a fantasy novel, with walls draped in thick, vibrant green moss and ferns, creating an atmosphere that feels almost primeval. Sunlight filters down in spotty beams, illuminating the stream that flows between the narrow walls.

The hidden waterfall at the end is relatively small compared to giants like Seljalandsfoss and Skógafoss, but the journey to reach it makes the experience uniquely rewarding. It's a reminder that in Iceland, sometimes the most memorable experiences are the ones you have to work a little harder to find.

This area lies in the shadow of three glaciers - Eyjafjallajökull to the west, Mýrdalsjökull to the east, and Tindfjallajökull to the north. This convergence of ice caps creates a unique microclimate and adds to the mysterious atmosphere of the ravine.

If you're looking for experiences off the standard tourist path on a return visit to Iceland, Nauthúsagil offers exactly the kind of hidden natural wonder that rewards more adventurous travelers. The hike through the ravine takes about 30-40 minutes round trip and requires waterproof footwear, but the enchanting environment makes it well worth the effort.

As we continue our journey east, the landscape will soon offer us views of Sólheimajökull, an outlet glacier from the larger Mýrdalsjökull ice cap, before we reach the magnificent Skógafoss waterfall.
