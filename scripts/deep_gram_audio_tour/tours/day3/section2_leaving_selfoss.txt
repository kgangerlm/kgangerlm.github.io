As we leave Selfoss behind, we're driving through one of Iceland's most important agricultural regions. The town's name means "Seal Waterfall," referring to the Ölfusá River that runs through it, which is Iceland's largest river by volume. The bridge we just crossed was first built in 1891 and marked a significant improvement in transportation between the south and Reykjavík.

This area is part of what Icelanders call Suðurland, or the Southern Region. It's home to many of Iceland's farms thanks to the relatively mild climate and the fertile soil enriched by volcanic ash. Look around and you'll notice numerous greenhouses - Iceland has embraced geothermal energy not just for heating homes but also for agriculture, allowing farmers to grow vegetables like tomatoes, cucumbers, and even bananas year-round despite the harsh climate.

The flat plains you're driving through were created by glacial outflows during the last ice age, when massive amounts of sediment were carried from the highlands to the coast by meltwater. These sediment plains are called "sandur" in Icelandic, and they're characteristic of landscapes shaped by glacial retreat.

As we continue east, keep an eye out for Icelandic horses in the pastures along the roadside. Despite their small stature, they're not ponies but a distinctive breed that has remained pure for over 1,000 years due to Iceland's ban on importing horses. These hardy animals have adapted perfectly to Iceland's harsh environment and develop a thick winter coat that helps them survive outdoors through the cold months.

We're now following Route 1, commonly known as the Ring Road. This 1,332-kilometer highway circles the entire island and was only fully completed in 1974, marking a major milestone in Iceland's infrastructure development. Before that, many communities remained isolated during winter months when mountain passes became impassable due to snow.

The road ahead will take us through increasingly dramatic landscapes as we approach the foothills of Eyjafjallajökull and other volcanoes that dominate the southern skyline.
