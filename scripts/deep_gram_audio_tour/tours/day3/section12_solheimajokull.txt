We're now passing near Sólheimajökull, one of Iceland's most accessible outlet glaciers. The name means "Home of the Sun Glacier," which might seem ironic for a mass of ice, but likely refers to the nearby farm Sólheimar rather than suggesting the glacier is particularly sunny.

Sólheimajökull extends from the main ice cap of Mýrdalsjökull, which covers the powerful Katla volcano. This glacier has become an important site for scientists studying climate change, as it has retreated significantly in recent decades. Since the 1990s, Sólheimajökull has been retreating at an average rate of about 50 meters per year, revealing a stark, lunar-like landscape that was previously covered by ice.

If you were to take the short detour to visit the glacier, you'd find a dramatically altered landscape compared to just 20-30 years ago. Where there was once solid ice, there's now a growing glacial lagoon at the glacier's terminus. The retreat has revealed distinctive geological features including glacial moraines - ridges of debris pushed along by the advancing ice - and a valley scraped clean by the movement of the glacier.

Guided glacier hikes are available here for those who want a closer experience with the ice. These tours provide crampons and ice axes and take visitors onto the glacier itself, where you can observe crevasses, ice caves, and the unique blue color that results from the compression of snow into ice over decades and centuries.

Glaciers like Sólheimajökull are powerful shapers of Iceland's landscape. As they advance, they scrape and grind the underlying rock, carrying debris along and depositing it at their edges. When they retreat, they leave behind distinctive U-shaped valleys, scattered erratics (large boulders transported by ice), and terminal moraines marking their furthest extent.

The meltwater from Sólheimajökull feeds into the Jökulsá á Sólheimasandi river, which we'll cross shortly. This river, like many glacial rivers in Iceland, carries a heavy load of fine sediment, giving it a characteristic milky gray color. These sediments eventually reach the coast, where they contribute to Iceland's distinctive black sand beaches.

As we continue east toward Vík, we're entering an area with some of Iceland's most iconic coastal landscapes, shaped by the ongoing volcanic activity that makes this country so geologically unique.
