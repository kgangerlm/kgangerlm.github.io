We've arrived at Seljalandsfoss, one of Iceland's most enchanting waterfalls. This 60-meter (200-foot) cascade flows over what was once an ancient sea cliff, creating a spectacular sight as water plummets into the pool below.

What makes Seljalandsfoss truly special is the cave-like path that circles behind the waterfall, offering you the rare opportunity to stand behind a curtain of falling water. This unique perspective was created naturally over thousands of years as the waterfall slowly eroded the rock face, creating a concave area behind the cascade.

As you approach the waterfall, notice how the sunlight interacts with the mist, often creating rainbows that dance in the spray. The constant moisture has also created a microclimate where moss and small plants thrive on the otherwise rocky terrain.

The water feeding Seljalandsfoss comes from the Eyjafjallaj√∂kull glacier, the same glacier that sits atop the volcano that erupted in 2010. The waterfall never freezes completely, even in winter, though its appearance changes dramatically with the seasons - from lush and green in summer to ice-encrusted in winter.

If you plan to walk behind the waterfall, prepare to get a little wet! The spray can be substantial, especially when it's windy. Waterproof clothing is definitely recommended, and watch your step, as the path can be slippery. The path is closed during winter months when ice makes it too dangerous.

For photography enthusiasts, Seljalandsfoss offers endless opportunities. Try capturing both wide-angle shots that show the full height of the falls and closer detail shots of water droplets catching the light. For a unique perspective, photos taken from behind the falls looking out through the water curtain can be particularly striking.

The name "Seljalandsfoss" comes from the farm Seljaland nearby. The term "foss" means waterfall in Icelandic, and you'll notice this suffix on many waterfall names throughout the country.

Take your time experiencing Seljalandsfoss - it's not just a visual spectacle but a multisensory experience. Feel the mist on your face, listen to the thunder of falling water, and breathe in the fresh, oxygen-rich air.
