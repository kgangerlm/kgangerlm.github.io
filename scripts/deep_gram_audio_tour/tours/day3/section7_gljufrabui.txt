Just a five-minute walk north from Seljalandsfoss lies one of Iceland's best-kept secrets - Gljúfrabúi waterfall, whose name translates to "Canyon Dweller." Unlike its famous neighbor, this magical cascade is partially hidden inside a narrow canyon, making it easy to miss if you don't know where to look.

To reach Gljúfrabúi, follow the path along the cliff face until you reach a narrow opening in the rock. The waterfall is tucked inside this crevice, with only a small portion visible from the outside. For the full experience, you'll need to wade through the shallow stream that flows from the canyon mouth.

Inside, you'll discover a cathedral-like chamber with moss-covered walls rising high above, and at its center, a powerful 40-meter waterfall plunging into a pool below. Sunlight filters through an opening at the top, creating an almost mystical atmosphere as it illuminates the falling water and swirling mist.

According to local folklore, this hidden canyon was once home to elves and hidden folk. It's easy to see why such stories emerged - the secluded, otherworldly environment feels like something from a fairy tale. Icelanders have a complex relationship with these mythological beings, and many still believe in their existence. A survey from the University of Iceland found that over 50% of Icelanders wouldn't deny the existence of elves, showing how deeply these beliefs are embedded in the culture.

Be prepared to get wet if you venture inside! The enclosed space means there's nowhere for the spray to escape. Waterproof clothing and sturdy shoes are essential - flip-flops aren't recommended as the rocks can be slippery.

If wading through water doesn't appeal, you can still glimpse the waterfall by climbing a small path to the left of the canyon entrance, which offers a partial view through a window in the rock.

Gljúfrabúi offers a more intimate waterfall experience than many of Iceland's larger cascades and is often less crowded than neighboring Seljalandsfoss. It's these hidden treasures that make exploring Iceland so rewarding - there's always another wonder waiting just around the corner.

The name Gljúfrabúi combines "gljúfur" meaning canyon or gorge, and "búi" meaning dweller - perfectly describing this waterfall that lives hidden within its rocky home.
