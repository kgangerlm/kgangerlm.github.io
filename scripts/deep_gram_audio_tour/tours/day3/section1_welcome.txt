Welcome to Day 3 of your Icelandic adventure! Today, you'll explore the dramatic southern coast of Iceland, one of the most visually stunning stretches of the Ring Road.

I'm especially excited because today Heather joins your journey! The South Coast showcases Iceland's incredible diversity - from towering waterfalls to expansive black sand beaches and fascinating coastal formations.

As we leave Selfoss behind, we're heading into a landscape shaped by the powerful forces of volcanism and glaciation. To your south lies the Atlantic Ocean, while to the north, you'll catch glimpses of glacier-capped volcanoes, including the infamous Eyjafjallaj√∂kull.

Today's journey will take you past thundering waterfalls, including one you can walk behind, and along beaches with sand as black as night. You'll see basalt columns formed by cooling lava and, if you're lucky, perhaps spot puffins nesting on coastal cliffs.

The South Coast experiences some of Iceland's most dramatic weather patterns. The mountains to the north often trap moisture coming off the ocean, creating a climate that can change rapidly. Keep an eye on the clouds today - even if it's raining in one location, you might find sunshine just a few kilometers down the road.

This dynamic weather has shaped not only the landscape but also the local folklore, with tales of trolls turned to stone and hidden elf dwellings. Icelanders maintain a special relationship with these mythological beings - you'll notice that many construction projects even today will alter their plans to avoid disturbing rocks believed to house the hidden folk.

As we begin our drive east, keep your eyes peeled for the changing landscape. The fertile farmlands around Selfoss will gradually give way to more dramatic terrain, with mountains pushing closer to the sea and waterfalls cascading from the highlands.

Let's start our adventure along Iceland's magnificent South Coast!
