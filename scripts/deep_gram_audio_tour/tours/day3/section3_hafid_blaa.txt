Coming up on our right, you'll notice a distinctive building with a giant red lobster sculpture - this is Hafið Bláa restaurant, whose name means "The Blue Sea." This quirky landmark celebrates Iceland's langoustine industry. While the largest langoustine harbor is in Höfn in East Iceland, these delicious crustaceans can be found along much of Iceland's south coast.

Beyond the restaurant lies an unmarked black sand beach that's far less visited than the famous beaches near Vík that we'll see later today. If you have time on your return journey, it's worth a stop for a peaceful experience of Iceland's volcanic coastline without the crowds.

Along this stretch of road, you can start to appreciate the constantly changing weather patterns that define the South Coast. Look out toward the ocean, then back toward the highlands, and you'll often see drastically different conditions. This meteorological dynamism creates spectacular lighting effects, especially when sunbeams break through clouds to spotlight specific features in the landscape - what photographers call "god rays."

We're now passing through an area that was once completely underwater. The coastline of Iceland is constantly changing due to volcanic activity, glacial flooding, and the powerful erosion of the Atlantic Ocean. Some of these coastal plains were created as recently as the last few centuries during major glacial flood events called jökulhlaups, which occur when volcanic eruptions beneath glaciers suddenly melt large amounts of ice.

The road we're on is following what was once the coastline thousands of years ago, before these sediment plains were formed. The cliffs we're approaching mark this ancient shoreline - today, they're home to numerous waterfalls as rivers from the highlands cascade over what were once sea cliffs.

Keep your eyes peeled for birds in this area. The wetlands near the coast support diverse birdlife, including Arctic terns that migrate annually from Antarctica to Iceland - the longest regular migration of any animal on Earth, covering about 70,000 kilometers each year.

As we continue east, the terrain will become increasingly dramatic, with the first glimpses of Iceland's iconic glacier-topped volcanoes appearing on the horizon.
