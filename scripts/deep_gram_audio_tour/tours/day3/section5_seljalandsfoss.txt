We're now approaching our first major stop of the day - Seljalandsfoss waterfall. You might already see the plume of mist rising into the air ahead. This 60-meter cascade is fed by melting water from the Eyjafjallajökull glacier, creating a spectacular natural display as water plummets from the ancient sea cliff.

What makes Seljalandsfoss unique among Iceland's many waterfalls is the path that circles behind the cascade. This rare feature offers visitors the chance to experience a waterfall from a perspective few other places in the world can match - standing behind a curtain of falling water with light filtering through.

As we get closer, you might notice several smaller waterfalls alongside Seljalandsfoss. This entire cliff face is dotted with cascades of varying sizes, formed as water from the highlands finds its way to the coast. The entire cliff line marks what was once Iceland's coastline thousands of years ago, before volcanic activity and glacial flooding extended the land southward.

The name Seljalandsfoss comes from the farm Seljaland, which is located nearby. The suffix "foss" is the Icelandic word for waterfall, a term you'll hear repeatedly throughout your journey. Interestingly, the farm Seljaland was mentioned in the medieval Book of Settlements (Landnámabók), which records the settlement of Iceland in the 9th and 10th centuries.

When you visit Seljalandsfoss, be prepared to get a little wet if you choose to walk behind the waterfall! The spray can be substantial, especially when it's windy. Waterproof clothing is definitely recommended, and watch your step, as the path can be slippery.

The best time to photograph Seljalandsfoss is during the golden hours of early morning or late evening when the sunlight illuminates the cascade with a magical glow. On sunny days, you might even catch a rainbow arcing through the mist.

The parking area has a small café and restrooms available. There's a parking fee of about 700 ISK that helps maintain the facilities at this popular site.

After exploring Seljalandsfoss, don't miss the opportunity to visit a hidden gem just a short walk north along the cliff face - Gljúfrabúi, or "Canyon Dweller," a partially concealed waterfall tucked inside a narrow canyon.
