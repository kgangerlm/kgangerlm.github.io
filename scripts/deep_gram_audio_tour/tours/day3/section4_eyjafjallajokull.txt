As we continue eastward, the landscape is becoming more dramatic, with mountains pushing closer to the road. Directly ahead is one of Iceland's most famous volcanoes - Eyjafjallajökull, which became world-famous in 2010 when it erupted, sending ash high into the atmosphere and grounding flights across Europe for weeks.

The name, which proved challenging for news reporters worldwide, simply means "Island Mountain Glacier" - "eyja" meaning island, "fjall" meaning mountain, and "jökull" meaning glacier. The "island" reference comes from the nearby Vestmannaeyjar (Westman Islands) that appear to be floating beside this massive volcano when viewed from certain angles.

Eyjafjallajökull stands 1,651 meters (5,417 feet) tall and is completely covered by an ice cap that's approximately 100 square kilometers in area. This combination of volcano and glacier is what made the 2010 eruption particularly disruptive - when hot magma meets glacial ice, it creates extremely fine ash particles that can rise high into the atmosphere and travel great distances.

Just east of Eyjafjallajökull is another, larger volcano-glacier system called Mýrdalsjökull, which covers Katla - one of Iceland's most powerful volcanoes. Historically, when Eyjafjallajökull erupts, Katla follows within months or years. Scientists have been monitoring Katla carefully since 2010, as an eruption there could be substantially larger than what we saw with Eyjafjallajökull.

The area between these two glaciers is home to Þórsmörk (Thor's Forest), one of Iceland's most beautiful highland areas. It's remarkably lush compared to the surrounding terrain because the mountains shelter it from the harshest weather. Þórsmörk is a popular hiking destination but requires a 4x4 vehicle to access due to numerous river crossings.

As we approach the foot of Eyjafjallajökull, you'll start to see the first of several spectacular waterfalls that characterize this stretch of the South Coast. These waterfalls form as glacial meltwater and rain cascade over the ancient sea cliffs that once marked Iceland's coastline before volcanic activity and glacial flooding extended the land southward.

Keep your camera ready - our first major waterfall stop at Seljalandsfoss is just ahead!
