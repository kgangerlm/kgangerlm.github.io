      To your right looms <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="mɪrdalsyœkʏhtl">Mýrdalsjökull</phoneme> glacier, Iceland's fourth largest ice cap. Beneath it slumbers <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="katla">Katla</phoneme>, a volcano historically more powerful than neighboring <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="eɪjafjahtlajœkʏhtl">Eyjafjallajökull</phoneme>. The last major <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="katla">Katla</phoneme> eruption in <say-as interpret-as="date" format="y">1918</say-as> produced enough meltwater to temporarily increase Iceland's surface area.

      Icelandic sagas and folk tales are rich with references to <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="katla">Katla</phoneme>. One legend claims the volcano was named after a female cook named <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="katla">Katla</phoneme> who owned magical pants that allowed the wearer to run without tiring. When a farmhand stole these pants, <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="katla">Katla</phoneme> pursued him into the glacier where she disappeared forever.

    <p>
      Notice how few farms dot this terrain. Unlike the fertile areas west of <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="skouɣafɔs">Skógafoss</phoneme>, this region has been repeatedly ravaged by volcanic eruptions and glacial floods, making long-term settlement precarious.
