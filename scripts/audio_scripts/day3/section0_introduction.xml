      Our journey takes us from <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="sɛlfɔs">Selfoss</phoneme> through an incredible landscape of thundering waterfalls, dramatic black sand beaches, and towering sea stacks. You'll walk behind the cascading waters of <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="sɛljalantsfɔs">Seljalandsfoss</phoneme>, feel the raw power of <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="skouɣafɔs">Skógafoss</phoneme>, and explore the otherworldly black beaches of <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="vɪkʏrfjara">Vikurfjara</phoneme> and <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="reɪnɪsfjara">Reynisfjara</phoneme>. We'll end at the majestic <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="dɪrhoʊlaɪ">Dyrhólaey</phoneme> peninsula before reaching our cozy accommodation at The Barn.
