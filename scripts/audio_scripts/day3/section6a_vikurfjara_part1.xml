      Here at <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="vɪkʏrfjara">Vikurfjara</phoneme>, we encounter what appears to be an alien landscape - a vastness of black sand stretching toward distant mountains. This shore represents the newest land in Europe, built from materials that were, geologically speaking, only recently molten rock deep beneath the earth.

      The ferocious surf before you has traveled unimpeded from Greenland or even North America, gathering tremendous energy across thousands of kilometers of open ocean. These waves are among the most dangerous in Iceland, with so-called 'sneaker waves' that can surge unexpectedly far up the beach. Local children are taught from an early age: 'Never turn your back on the Atlantic.'
