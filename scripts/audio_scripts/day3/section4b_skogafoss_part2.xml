      According to legend, the first Viking settler in this area, <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="θrasi θouroulfssɔn">Þrasi Þórólfsson</phoneme>, hid a chest full of gold behind the waterfall. Many have searched for this treasure over the centuries. In the early <say-as interpret-as="ordinal">18</say-as> century, local boys found one end of the chest but could only retrieve its ring handle before the chest disappeared again.

      In the <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="njauls">Njáls</phoneme> Saga, one of Iceland's most famous medieval literary works, characters travel through this region on their way to the Althing, the world's oldest parliamentary assembly. The power and beauty of <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="skouɣafɔs">Skógafoss</phoneme> would have been as awe-inspiring to medieval Icelanders as it is to us today.
