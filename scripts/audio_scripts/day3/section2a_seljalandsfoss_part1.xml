      Here at <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="sɛljalantsfɔs">Seljalandsfoss</phoneme>, nature has created one of her most enchanting spectacles. This is not merely a waterfall, but a complete liquid curtain cascading <say-as interpret-as="cardinal">60</say-as> meters down an ancient sea cliff.

      What makes this place truly remarkable is the cave behind it - carved over millennia as water gradually eroded the softer rock layers beneath the harder basalt cap. I invite you to walk the path and experience a perspective that few waterfalls worldwide can match.

      As you venture behind the falls, observe how the light plays through the falling water, creating ever-shifting patterns as the sun's angle changes. Notice the dark basalt layers in the cliff face. Each represents a different volcanic eruption, laid down like pages in Iceland's geological history book.
