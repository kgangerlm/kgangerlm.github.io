        Hi Heather and Keith, welcome to day 3 of your trip! <break time="500ms"/> Today we'll be exploring Iceland's spectacular South Coast, discovering treasures that showcase the raw power of nature's ongoing creation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our journey takes us from <lang xml:lang="is-IS">Selfoss</lang> through an incredible landscape of thundering waterfalls, dramatic black sand beaches, and towering sea stacks. You'll walk behind the cascading waters of <lang xml:lang="is-IS">Seljalandsfoss</lang>, feel the raw power of <lang xml:lang="is-IS">Skógafoss</lang>, and explore the otherworldly black beaches of <lang xml:lang="is-IS">Vikurfjara</lang> and <lang xml:lang="is-IS">Reynisfjara</lang>. We'll end at the majestic <lang xml:lang="is-IS">Dyrhólaey</lang> peninsula before reaching our cozy accommodation at The Barn.

        Let our adventure begin as we trace the path of Iceland's waters from ancient glacier to powerful waterfall to the vast and turbulent sea.
