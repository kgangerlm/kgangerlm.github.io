        <lang xml:lang="is-IS">Reynisfjara</lang> presents one of Earth's most striking demonstrations of how mathematical principles underpin natural forms. The hexagonal basalt columns before you weren't carved by human hands but formed through a process akin to drying mud. As thick lava flows cooled from the surface downward, the contracting material cracked in patterns that minimized energy - resulting in these remarkably uniform hexagonal pillars.

        Similar formations exist at the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland and on Scotland's Isle of Staffa - not by coincidence, but because they formed from the same volcanic system when these landmasses were positioned much closer together before continental drift pulled them apart.
