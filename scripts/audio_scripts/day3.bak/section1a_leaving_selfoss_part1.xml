        Good morning, and welcome to one of our planet's most extraordinary geological wonders. <break time="500ms"/> As you leave <lang xml:lang="is-IS">Selfoss</lang> behind, you're driving across what might appear to be an ordinary landscape. <break time="300ms"/> But here, beneath your very wheels, lies a profound boundary - the Mid-Atlantic Ridge - where the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates are slowly pulling apart.

        Look to your left, where the snow-capped <lang xml:lang="is-IS">Eyjafjallajökull</lang> stands sentinel over the landscape. Within that gleaming ice cap lies a chamber of molten rock - a reminder that Iceland is, in geological terms, just an infant, born of fire and constantly remaking itself.

        The flat plains extending toward the ocean represent land in its infancy. When the Viking settlers arrived over a thousand years ago, the coastline stood much closer to those mountains. These Norse settlers, led by figures like Ingólfur Arnarson, established the first permanent settlements in Iceland around <say-as interpret-as="date" format="year">874</say-as> CE, marking the beginning of Iceland's recorded history.
