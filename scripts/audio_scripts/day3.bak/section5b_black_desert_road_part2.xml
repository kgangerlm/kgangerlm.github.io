        To your right looms <lang xml:lang="is-IS">Mýrdalsjökull</lang> glacier, Iceland's fourth largest ice cap. Beneath it slumbers <lang xml:lang="is-IS">Katla</lang>, a volcano historically more powerful than neighboring <lang xml:lang="is-IS">Eyjafjallajökull</lang>. The last major <lang xml:lang="is-IS">Katla</lang> eruption in <say-as interpret-as="date" format="year">1918</say-as> produced enough meltwater to temporarily increase Iceland's surface area.
      </p>

      <p>
        Icelandic sagas and folk tales are rich with references to <lang xml:lang="is-IS">Katla</lang>. One legend claims the volcano was named after a female cook named <lang xml:lang="is-IS">Katla</lang> who owned magical pants that allowed the wearer to run without tiring. When a farmhand stole these pants, <lang xml:lang="is-IS">Katla</lang> pursued him into the glacier where she disappeared forever.

      <p>
        Notice how few farms dot this terrain. Unlike the fertile areas west of <lang xml:lang="is-IS">Skógafoss</lang>, this region has been repeatedly ravaged by volcanic eruptions and glacial floods, making long-term settlement precarious.
