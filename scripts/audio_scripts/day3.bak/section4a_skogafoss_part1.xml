        Behold <lang xml:lang="is-IS">Skógafoss</lang> - one of Iceland's most magnificent waterfalls. The sheer volume of water creates an atmosphere that is not merely seen but felt - a constant vibration in the air and a thunderous roar that speaks to something primal within us.

        The cliff face you see represents that same ancient coastline we've been following, but here the geological story is particularly clear. Look carefully at the rock layers, and you can identify at least twenty distinct lava flows that created this formidable wall - each marking a separate eruption spanning thousands of years.

        The name <lang xml:lang="is-IS">Skógafoss</lang> translates as 'Forest Falls,' though you'll notice little forest remains today. When Norse settlers arrived in the <say-as interpret-as="ordinal">9th</say-as> century, birch woodlands covered up to <say-as interpret-as="cardinal">40</say-as>% of Iceland's surface. Within a century, most had been cleared for timber and grazing land.
