    </div>

    <div class="tip">
        <h4>Pro Tip</h4>
        <p>The duty-free shop at Keflav√≠k Airport is the cheapest place to buy alcohol in Iceland. Stock up on arrival, as prices in stores and restaurants are significantly higher due to Iceland's alcohol taxes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="notes">
        <h4>Notes</h4>
        <p>Jet lag management: Try to stay awake until at least 9PM local time to help adjust to the time difference. The Blue Lagoon is perfectly positioned for this - the warm waters and serene atmosphere will help recover from your flight while keeping you awake.</p>
        <p>During summer, daylight lasts nearly 24 hours, which can make sleeping challenging. Your hotel may have blackout curtains, but consider bringing an eye mask.</p>

        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
        <h4>Pro Tip</h4>
        <p>For the Reykjadalur Hot Spring hike, bring water shoes for the river, a quick-dry towel, and swimwear worn under your hiking clothes to make changing easier. The further upriver you go, the hotter the water gets, so you can find your perfect temperature.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="notes">
        <h4>Notes</h4>
        <p>The Golden Circle gets crowded by mid-day, which is why an early start is recommended. By following this itinerary, you'll be ahead of most tour buses.</p>
        <p>The path to Reykjadalur can be muddy and slippery even in summer, so good hiking shoes are essential. The hot river has no facilities beyond simple wooden privacy screens for changing, so come prepared.</p>

The path leading behind the waterfall can be slippery but offers an unforgettable experience as you feel the power of the water from inside the cascade. Golden hour lighting in early morning or evening creates magical photo opportunities as the light shines through the water. Parking fee: $6. Don't miss Glj√∫frab√∫i, a hidden waterfall just a short walk away that's tucked inside a cliff.</li>
        <li class="featured">‚ú® <strong>Sk√≥gafoss Waterfall</strong> (18 miles from Seljalandsfoss) - One of Iceland's biggest and most beautiful waterfalls at 200 feet high and 82 feet wide. The massive amount of spray produces frequent rainbows on sunny days. Climb the 527 steps to the viewing platform at the top for spectacular panoramic views of the South Coast and the beginning of the famous Fimmv√∂r√∞uh√°ls hiking trail. Legend says a settler hid a treasure chest behind the waterfall, and the metal handle on the chest can sometimes be seen from the right angle.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Afternoon</h3>
    <ul>
        <li class="featured">‚ú® <strong>Vikurfjara Black Sand Beach</strong> (near V√≠k, 19 miles from Sk√≥gafoss) - This stunning black sand beach offers dramatic views of massive basalt columns, sea stacks, and powerful Atlantic waves. The stark contrast between the black sand, white surf, and towering cliffs makes for incredible photos. Be extremely cautious of "sneaker waves" that can appear without warning - never turn your back to the ocean and stay well away from the water's edge. This friend-recommended site captures the raw power of Iceland's volcanic coastline.</li>

    <div class="tip">
        <h4>Pro Tip</h4>
        <p>When visiting Seljalandsfoss, bring a waterproof jacket and protect your camera gear. The spray from walking behind the waterfall will soak you, even on a calm day. Visit early morning or late evening to avoid the largest crowds.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="notes">
        <h4>Notes</h4>
        <p>Stock up on groceries at Kr√≥nan in Selfoss before departing, as food options become more limited and expensive as you travel east.</p>
        <p>The weather on the South Coast can change rapidly. Dress in layers and be prepared for wind and rain even on sunny days. Always have rain gear accessible in the car.</p>

Consider revisiting Diamond Beach at different tide levels, as new ice pieces arrive with each tide.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="notes">
        <h4>Notes</h4>
        <p>Remember your Zodiac boat tour booking. Arrive 30 minutes before departure time and dress warmly - it's always colder on the water, even in July. The tour provides flotation suits for safety and warmth.</p>
        <p>When photographing glaciers and ice, try using a polarizing filter to reduce glare and enhance the blue colors of the ice.</p>

        <h4>Pro Tip</h4>
        <p>When seal watching, bring binoculars if you have them and keep a respectful distance of at least 50 meters. Mornings and evenings are typically best for spotting seals lounging on the rocks. Moving slowly and quietly will increase your chances of seeing them.</p>

        <p>This is primarily a travel day, but the stops break up the journey and offer glimpses into different aspects of Icelandic nature and culture. Be flexible with your schedule, as some stops might captivate you more than others.</p>
        <p>Check the weather forecast for Sn√¶fellsnes, as it can be quite different from other parts of Iceland. The peninsula is known for rapidly changing conditions, so be prepared for various weather scenarios.</p>

        <p>The weather on Sn√¶fellsnes can change quickly and be quite different from other parts of Iceland. The peninsula is exposed to weather from all sides, so be prepared for wind, rain, or sudden fog, even in summer.</p>
        <p>Take some time today to start organizing your belongings for tomorrow's departure. Check what time you need to return your rental car and calculate drive time to the airport for your 4:50 PM flight.</p>
