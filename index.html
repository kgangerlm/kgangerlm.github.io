</div>
<div class="notes-box">
Wear waterproof clothing for Seljalandsfoss, as you will get wet when walking behind it. Consider visiting Reynisfjara during off-peak hours (early morning or evening) for fewer crowds. The puffin viewing at Dyrh√≥laey is seasonal (May-August), and the site may have restricted access during nesting season.

<div class="tip-box">
Evenings are best for puffin viewing as they return from fishing trips. Bring binoculars if you have them for even better viewing, though they're not essential at Hafnarh√≥lmi since the viewing platforms get quite close to the nesting sites. Be respectful of wildlife and maintain the recommended distance from the birds.
</div>
<div class="notes-box">
Stock up on groceries for your self-catering cabin before arriving in this remote area. There are limited shopping options between Egilssta√∞ir and √Åsgeirssta√∞ir. Hiking poles are helpful for the Br√∫nav√≠k trail, especially on steeper sections. The St√≥rur√∞ hike can be muddy after rain, so appropriate footwear is essential.

</ul>

<div class="tip-box">
Road 864 to Dettifoss (east side) is rougher but offers better views. Be prepared for wet conditions near the falls due to constant spray, and wear sturdy footwear on the sometimes slippery paths.

</div>
<div class="notes-box">
This is a *very* long driving day with multiple significant stops. Consider prioritizing 2-3 main attractions rather than attempting everything. Dettifoss and Go√∞afoss are must-sees, while the others can be considered optional depending on your interests and energy levels. Be mindful of cruise ship passengers in Akureyri which can make restaurants busier on certain days.

<h3>Morning</h3>
<div class="activity-item"><span class="activity-time">08:00</span> Breakfast at The Old Post Office.</div>
<div class="activity-item"><span class="activity-time">09:00</span> <span class="featured"><strong>Dj√∫pal√≥nssandur Black Pebble Beach</strong></span>: A short walk through a lava field leads to this rugged coastline with distinctive smooth black pebbles shaped by the ocean. See the remains of the British trawler Epine that wrecked here in 1948 and test your strength on the four lifting stones used by fishermen to prove their worthiness for sea work (ranging from 23 to 154 kg). <a href="https://guidetoiceland.is/travel-iceland/drive/djupalonssandur" target="_blank">[Link]</a> (1-1.5 hours)</div>
<div class="activity-item"><span class="activity-time">10:30</span> <span class="featured"><strong>Hellnar to Arnarstapi Coastal Path</strong></span>: A stunning 2.5-mile one-way hike (you can return the same way or arrange drop-off/pickup) with dramatic coastal views. The trail follows cliff tops overlooking natural arches, bird cliffs, basalt columns, and unusual rock formations. Watch for kittiwakes and fulmars nesting on the cliffs, and enjoy views of the Sn√¶fellsj√∂kull glacier on clear days. <a href="https://guidetoiceland.is/travel-iceland/drive/arnarstapi-hellnar" target="_blank">[Link]</a> (2-3 hours for the full roundtrip)</div>
<div class="activity-item"><span class="activity-time">13:30</span> <span class="featured"><strong>Vatnshellir Cave</strong></span>: Explore this 8,000-year-old lava tube with a guided tour. Descend 35 meters into this fascinating underground world formed during an eruption from a nearby crater. The specialized lighting reveals the colorful mineral deposits and lava formations. <a href="https://summitguides.is/tours/vatnshellir-cave-tour/" target="_blank">[Link]</a> Guided tours only, $35 per person.

<div class="activity-item"><span class="activity-time">15:30</span> <span class="featured"><strong>Ytri Tunga Beach</strong></span>: Visit this seal colony, best viewed at low tide. Unlike most of Iceland's volcanic shores, this is one of the few golden sand beaches in the country. You can usually see 10-20 harbor seals lounging on the rocks just offshore. Bring binoculars if you have them for closer viewing without disturbing the animals. <a href="https://guidetoiceland.is/travel-iceland/drive/ytri-tunga-beach" target="_blank">[Link]</a> (45 minutes - 1 hour)</div>
<div class="activity-item"><span class="activity-time">16:45</span> <span class="featured"><strong>Landbrotalaug Hot Spring</strong></span>: This tiny, hidden natural hot pot is big enough for 2-3 people. Look for a small parking area near a disused farm building, then walk about 100 meters. The secluded setting surrounded by lava fields makes it a unique experience away from the tourist crowds. There's also a larger warm pool nearby if the hot pot is occupied. Coordinates: 64.8391, -22.2806. (1-1.5 hours including finding it!)</div>
<div class="activity-item"><span class="activity-time">18:15</span> <strong>Ger√∞uberg Basalt Columns</strong>: A short stop on the way to Akranes to see this symmetrical wall of hexagonal basalt columns stretching for nearly 1 km. These perfectly formed columns, some reaching 14 meters in height, were created when thick lava cooled slowly and evenly, allowing crystallization to form these distinctive hexagonal shapes ‚Äì an impressive example of volcanic geology. <a href="https://guidetoiceland.is/travel-iceland/drive/gerduberg-basalt-columns" target="_blank">[Link]</a> (20-30 minutes)</div>
