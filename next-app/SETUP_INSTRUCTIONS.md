# Iceland Trip Diary - Next.js Migration Setup

This document provides detailed instructions for setting up and running the refactored Next.js version of the Iceland Trip Diary application.

## Migration Overview

We've successfully migrated the Svelte app to Next.js with the following components:

- Complete TypeScript type system for all data structures
- React components replacing all Svelte components
- Server-side data loading with Next.js data fetching
- Dynamic routing for day pages
- Preserved all styling and UI elements
- Mobile-friendly swipe navigation

## Setup Process

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, navigate to the Next.js app directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd next-app
npm install
```

If the react-intersection-observer package installation failed previously, install it separately:

```bash
npm install react-intersection-observer
```

### 2. Copy Data Files

The data files have already been copied from the original project to the Next.js app's public directory. If you need to copy them again, run:

```bash
node scripts/copy-data.js
```

### 3. Run Development Server

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Next.js development server, typically on http://localhost:3000.

### 4. Build for Production

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate static HTML files in the `out` directory that can be deployed to any static hosting service.

## Project Structure

- **Components**: All UI components are in the `/components` directory
- **Pages**: Page templates are in the `/app` directory following Next.js App Router convention
- **Data**: JSON data files are in the `/public/data` directory
- **Types**: TypeScript types are in the `/types` directory
- **Utils**: Data fetching utilities are in the `/utils` directory

## Features Implemented

1. **Homepage with Trip Overview**: Shows trip summary and day cards
2. **Individual Day Pages**: Detailed view for each day with activities
3. **Navigation System**: Easy navigation between days with previous/next buttons
4. **Mobile Swipe Navigation**: Touch-friendly navigation on mobile devices
5. **Responsive Design**: Maintains the original responsive layout

## Known Issues & Future Improvements

- The ScrollSpy component requires the react-intersection-observer package
- Mobile swipe tutorial might need additional testing on various devices
- Client-side navigation could be further optimized for performance

## Deployment

The app is configured for static export and can be deployed to GitHub Pages or any static hosting service:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will build the app and push it to the gh-pages branch for deployment.
