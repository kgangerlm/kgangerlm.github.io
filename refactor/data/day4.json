  "notes": "The boat tour on Jökulsárlón is weather-dependent - have a backup plan in case of cancellation. Dress in warm, waterproof layers for the zodiac tour as it can be quite cold on the water. Höfn is known as the langoustine (mini lobster) capital of Iceland, so trying this local specialty is highly recommended if you enjoy seafood."
